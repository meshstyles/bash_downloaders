## how to develop extensions

-   create a new folder
-   create a `script.sh` in that folder
-   create a self contained download script here that follows the following specifications
    -   the script should only need one argument which is the link to the content
    -   the link used in the downloader is a variable called `link`
    -   if a useragent is user it should be a variable called `useragent`
    -   there needs to be a url for which the module supports. it needs to be only one link.
    -   the link should be denoted like `#link "url.domain/"` or `#link "url.domain/videos"`
    -   set up link, useragent and the applicable link filter in your self contained script before `#cutoff`
    -   after `#cutoff` should the fully working and fully self contained part which only rely on `link` and `useragent`
-   create a new branch and put in a pull request if you want to contribute

### dev dependencies

-   the script is for bash so you need bash and the default tools
-   dos2unix since some files might be formatted the wrong way

## upcoming

-   a better readme
-   debian setup script (maybe)

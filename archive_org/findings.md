# archive org

archive.org has a public and well documented api that returns json or xml. read more [here](https://archive.org/services/docs/api/md-read.html).  
there also are several autogenerated file which I'd rather not download eventhough they are small.

This module has been taken from [little_helpers](https://github.com/meshstyles/little_helpers/tree/master/bash/archive_tools).  
But it's a cut down version without support to download multiple listings in series.
